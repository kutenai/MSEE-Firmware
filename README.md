Firmware from my MSEE project

This is the firmware that I wrote for my GyroGlove project. This project was for my MSEE thesis.

The gyro glove is a custom hardware board that interfaces to 6 six degree-of-freedom IMU units.
All of the hardware was custome designed and implemented. The main board used an Atmel microprocessor
to collect the IMU data via SPI. This data was combined and then send via USB to the host computer.
The gyroglove uses a wired USB which provides power and data transfer to the system.
